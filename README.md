## Objective:
- A Data Acquisition (DAQ) System for interfacing with the vehicle ECU and additional sensors.
- Build the first fully-fledged DAQ with re-usable code through:
    - The Layered Architecture design pattern
    - Modularity of components
    - Hardware abstraction
- Efficiently record data to a CSV file for system testing & refinement of other vehicle components via analyses.
- Make sensor data conveniently accessible for the whole DFR organization.
- To be used in tandem with DFR's [DataAnalyzer](https://github.com/DallasFormulaRacing/DataAnalyzer)
